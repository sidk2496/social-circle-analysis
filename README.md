# Social Circle Analysis

[View report here](docs/report.pdf)

With the massive amount of information generated by social networks everyday,
it is becoming increasingly important to organize this data. One way to do so
is by grouping them into social circles (a group of people having some common
attributes). In this project, we address the problem of automatically discovering
social circles in a network induced by a user and his friends called an ego-network.
We propose a novel hierarchical, non-parametric approach to solving this prob-
lem which exploits both the structural information as well as the user-attribute
information using the principle of homophily. Our method addresses one of the
major drawbacks of hierarchical clustering that it does not allow the formation of
overlapping clusters. Another strength of our algorithm is that it does not require
the a priori information of the number of social circles. Results on the Facebook
dataset of ego-networks show that our method performs on comparable terms to
benchmark results.
